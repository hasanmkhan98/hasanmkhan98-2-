# From when I was young, I entered computer science because of my interest in video games. Back then, a lot of time was spent by me doing programming on ROBLOX Studio where I enjoyed making my own virtual worlds and games. This experience made me want to create better and more complex games, and shifted me into more exploration into programming.

# As time passed, I increased my abilities by acquiring knowledge in languages such as C++, C, and Python. This gave me an important base for my journey through coding. Now, I have started to gain an understanding of Java while also experimenting with React. Every step has intensified the love towards computer science, which motivates me to continue turning my dreams into a reality.
